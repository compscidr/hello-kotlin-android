# hello-kotlin-android
When starting a new project, I always find getting the tools up and running quickly is a pain, so I
wanted something for Kotlin which already had everything setup and working.

This aims to be a starter repo with all of the following tooling setup:
* [Junit5](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/)

TODO:
* [Jacoco](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/)
* [Github actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gradle-android)
* [klint](https://ktlint.github.io/)
* [Mockk](https://mockk.io/ANDROID.html)
* [r8](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/11/r8-new-code-shrinker-from-google-is.html)
* [Dokka](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka)
* Integration test stubs
* Instrumented test stubs
* Badges for the various workflow tools
